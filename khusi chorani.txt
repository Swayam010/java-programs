***Once in a river there lived three big fishes they were best friends.
***One day they were swimmimg in the,suddenly they saw two fishermen were
talking one of them said there are many tomorrow we will catch them 
and sale them in the market.
***Hearing their conversations the sceond fish said to her friends,
friends,"I think we should live this place and go to some safe place",
but the other two fish did not agree with the second fish and said, 
"No we will stay here as this place belongs to our ancestors." 
***Then in the evening second fish with some other fish of the river bid
them goodbye and went to some safe place.
***Both of the first and third fish got caught in the net 
and lost there lives.
